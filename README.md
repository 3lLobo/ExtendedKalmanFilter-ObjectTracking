Therefore we used simulated lidar and radar measurements to detect a bicycle that travels around our vehicle. We used a Kalman filter, lidar measurements and radar measurements to track the bicycle's position and velocity.![Flow](/process_flow.png)## Code StyleThe code is written in C++ to ensure fast performance. Another aspect why C++ was chosen over Python is the power to control and access variables from their location.The style in which this repository is coded conforms to Google's C++ style guide.## Structure of the CodeThe different files have the following tasks:* main.cpp - reads in data, calls a function to run the Kalman filter, calls a function to calculate RMSE and sends a sensor measurement to FusionEKF.cpp* FusionEKF.cpp - initializes the filter, calls the predict function, calls the update function. It also takes the sensor data and initializes variables and updates variables. The Kalman filter equations are not in this file. FusionEKF.cpp has a variable called ekf_, which is an instance of a KalmanFilter class. The ekf_ will hold the matrix and vector values. You will also use the ekf_ instance to call the predict and update equations.* kalman_filter.cpp- defines the predict function, the update function for lidar, and the update function for radar * tools.cpp- function to calculate RMSE and the Jacobian matrix
